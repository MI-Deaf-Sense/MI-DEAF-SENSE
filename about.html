    <h2>About MI DEAF SENSE</h2>
    <p>
      Born from tradition, fueled by innovation — we are a beacon for the Deaf community.
      Our mission is clear: to raise Deaf leaders, to protect futures, and to celebrate culture through every hand sign and every heartbeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guided by wisdom of the past and vision of tomorrow, we honor God’s calling to uplift, to serve, and to empower.
